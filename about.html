  <div id="howTo">
    <p id="howToText">PC-part Estimator is a personal development project developed by a Hudson M, with the purpose to give beginner PC sellers an estimated price to sell their PC. This service requires you input all the components in the computer your trying to sell then interacts with E-bay's API to determine the best price for that item based on past sold versions of that component. A design decision was made to make the components choosing segment as beginner friendly as possible, and therefore only allows you to select the standard or broad variants of your parts. This means if you have a special limited edition part that you think might sell for more then unfortunately this service will not find an accurate price for that specific part. If you have a GPU for example thats a 6700xt this will only looks at the price for the term 6700xt and will not look at specific card models and manufacturers of that card, this decision was made with the assumption that most buyers generally buy based on card type and not specifics like the model and manufacturers.</p>
